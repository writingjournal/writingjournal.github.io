She approached the unfamiliar door and nervously took the key from her pocket. She took a deep breath, unlocked the door, paused, then opened it. To her horror she saw blood stains on the walls of the hallway leading up to the door. A terrible stench filled her nose. She immediately pulled out her gun and called HQ for backup. Footsteps could be heard upstairs, someone had heard her coming in. This was bad. This was not how her first day on the police force was supposed to go. She slowly moved forward one inch at a time and peeped through an open door on the right. She saw a marble counter-top with pots and pans in a sink. It was the kitchen. There were no sounds coming from that dirtection. She moved closer not knowking whether the kitchen was empty, or if there was someone waiting in ambush. As she moved closer, she saw someone.

(She's conflicted on whether she should shout a warning or approach slowly. Eventually discovers that it's a dead body slumped on a chair in front of the kitchen table. The key was handed to her by an informant.)
