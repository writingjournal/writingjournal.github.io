I jogged along the path that ran through the forest. I loved these early monrning walks, with nothing around me except mother nature. After another 15 minutes of jogging, my breath started to get heavier. It hadn't been long since I started to excercise and 15 minutes was around my limit. I pushed myself to keep going for another 5 minutes, and then I was done. I sat down on a nearby rock and looked around. This was the farthest that I'd ever come. I sat there with random thoughts going through my mind, occasionally taking sips of water from my waterbottle, when suddenly i thought I saw something colorful at the base of a tree. I squinted to get a better look, the tree wasn't that far from me, but I still couldn't make out hat the thing was. My curiousity got the better of me and I got up and walked over to it. It seemed like a piece of fabric colored blue and red, burried under a pile of leaves. I hunched down, grabbed hold of it and pulled. As soon as a third of it got uncovered, I realized that it was a flag. But to my surprise, I couldn't pick it up. Something was holding it down. I began swiping away the leaves with my hands, and then i started to dig out the dirt with my hands. I didn't think I had enough energy to do any hard labour, but I surprised myself by going at it for another 30 minutes out of sheer curiosity. Finally I hot something, it was a box. It took every ounce of my remaining strength to pull the box out of the ground. It was a wooden box with a metal frame on the edges, and a lock on the lid. But the lock was broken. I excitedly pulled off the lock and chucked it someone unceremoneously, and opened the box.. It was empty. I lay down on the ground, too tired to move, and took my phone out of my pocket. It still had reception. this was the upside of not having enough energy to walk too far. I called a friend to come pick me up, and then just stayed there on the ground and waited.
