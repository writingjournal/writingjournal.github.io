# 55 Word Short Story

Sama walked briskly down the walkway leading up to the her new house. She had tried to put on a neutral colored hijab that wouldn't draw too much attention to herself. She looked around nervously to check if anyone was staring. It was her first day in this neighbourhood and she had no idea what to expect from her neighbours. All she wanted was to get inside and relax without having to worry about being judged by people around her. She hastily took out the keys to the front door, shoved it into the lock, and turned the handle.. The door wouldn't budge.. Her mind went blank for a moment. What exactly had just happened? She frantically tried to unlock the door again and again, but it simply wouldn't. She started to get more and more agitated and confused. Was the lock damaged? Did the landlord give her the wrong key? Was something blocking the door from the other sidWhat would she do now? Was she homeless now? Suddenly she remembered that she'd been suspecting her landlady of being an unethical hag that kept a spare key to the house, now this was her last hope. She reached into her other pocket to grab her phone. But unexpectedly, something metallic brushed against her fingers when she did. She pulled it out of her pocket, it was a key. She stared at it for a while, then stared at the key she'd been attempting to use till now. Then she slammed her palm onto her face as she realized that she'd been using the wrong key.
